# Micro-architecture modification in RTL for RISC-V
This project modifies and enhance an existing structural model of a single-issue 5-stage RISC-V processor in order to improve its performance. 
## Acknowledgement

## Modifications
* Data forwarding (to be implemented)
* Branch prediction (to be implemented)
* Tomasulo's algorithm (to be implemented)
* basic unsupported instrcutions (to be implemented)
* RISCV Vector Extension (to be implemented)

[elec5140_project](https://github.com/146snk/elec5140_project): the original version of the project. As the original version has messy file and module structure, as well as inconsistent naming conventions, it is decided that this new project would be a revamp on the original project, solving the problems mentioned above to improved the ease of further development.
